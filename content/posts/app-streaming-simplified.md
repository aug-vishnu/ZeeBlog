  applications through a browser with the help of cloud resources.

Imagine accessing an application like Android studio, PyCharm, VS Code without actually installing it in your local machine or going through the chaos of choosing, if it has to be a .zip file or .exe file. Or think about the things we need to consider before installing an Desktop Application:

* **Disk Space**: Amount of disk space that an application utilises on the user’s machine.
* **Security**: Applications that we are installing are found from trusted sources.
* **RAM Usage:** Overall usage of the system resources by an application.
* **Updates:** To get the newer version of all the list of packages to keep the application upto date.

But, What if all your applications are just a click away and ready to use ? With modern cloud technologies, it’s all well within the reach. 

## Introduction to Application Streaming:

It enables the user to access the application “On demand” as per their convenience or will. Unlike conventional Application virtualization, it eases the process of how an application is being delivered at the end-point device. By acquiring the particular piece of code rather than simulating the entire runtime environment, users can get speedy access to the streamed application. Stream server is responsible for storing the packaged application. Like other media streaming servers which transports multimedia content to client machines, users can access and run the software on-demand.

## How webRTC bring this to action:

Before we begin with webRTC, let’s get a brief idea on API. API - Application Programming interface is a messenger that takes requests and tells a system what you want to do and process the information, then returns the response back to you. It helps you to have seamless connectivity. Technically, an API is a piece of code which is permitted legally by the developer and can be reused in a software or application for other solitary purposes. Thus increases productivity, reduces workload, supports faster and easier data migration.

WebRTC implements API in order to stream the desktop application and deliver it to your browser. WebRTC based apps first get the desktop application data along with network information such IP addresses, ports, and establish connection between client machines. 

To exchange the facts that are being collected, APIs are being used by WebRTC apps and you can see the desktop application functioning astonishingly on top of the browser.

## Adapting to the drift:

Running these resource intensive applications has to be on a server that has to ensure performance, scalability, and availability. Sounds like something that we used to? Yes, Cloud server would be the optimum choice for this use case. One of the top vendors who provide the servers with this functionalities includes Amazon AppStream 2.0.

Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a “fully managed application streaming” service that provides users with instant access to their desktop applications from anywhere. Integrating webRTC with this service provides us with the utility that serves the purpose of Accessing and running applications through a browser with the help of cloud resources. Just right !

## Does this actually benefit the end user?

Why not ! Running desktop applications without making use of our own resources would enhance fast and smooth working of your computers altogether. Some benefits that we need to consider to go on,

* On-demand resources: App contents are hosted in the central server which results in small size of the application and apps which are in infrequent use can be stored remotely.
* Collaboration: Connecting everyone in the process and to obtain a quality product is made feasible by accessing the collaborative tool through browser.
* Portable: Programs can run on different machines with no platform dependency.
* Consistent: Since computing capabilities of the application does not rely on local devices, this method imparts stable performance. 
* Performance: High performance is the key expectation of any software. Utilization of cloud resources will drastically increase the performance.
* Compatibility: In addition to platform independency, If we run an application through a browser it is application independent. With a minimal effort, the application will be supported by all the major browsers, on desktop and mobile devices.

## Can things go worse?

* There are situations when there is a downtime of the vendor who is providing all the essential hardware resources results in offering average user experience. 
* Accessing applications that are specific to the production environment through web browsers has to guarantee data confidentiality. 
* Running a desktop application in the browser would need a fair internet speed for finer operation. 

## Conclusion:

Administering the desktop application through simple click in the browser seems to be a viable solution to efficiently take advantage of existing hardware resources in the cloud. To procure a personalised experience by running an on-demand standalone application seems to be a promising technology in the current trends.
